# We Have Moved

I made this page for my partner **@doughmination** to put on  
`discord.butterfly-network.win` to let people know that the service has moved to:

https://discord.doughmination.win

It’s a simple static site meant to clearly communicate the move and avoid confusion from old links or bookmarks.

If you like my work, feel free to ⭐ star this repo and follow my GitHub 🙂
